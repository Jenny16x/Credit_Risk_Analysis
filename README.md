# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

<p>The purpose of this analysis is use machine learning algorithms to make predictions for an imbalanced dataset with credit risk loans.  </p>

## Results

<p>The results shows that 
<ol>
<li>Using the oversampling method, the results shows…
- Precision for high risk is 0.01 
- Precision for low risk is 1.00
- Recall for high risk is 0.70 
- Recall for low risk is 0.62
- F1 for high risk is 0.02 
- Precision1 for low risk is 0.77  </li>
